# SEP11 Freedom Project
By: Nina Li (Partner: Cindy Li)

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about making an application that uses Javascript to perform one/multiple functions. The purpose of this blog is to present my process in making my application with what I have learned using Javascript and Firebase.

## Content
For my project, I am making a To-Do List. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying my tool Firebase in order to make my To-Do List application.
