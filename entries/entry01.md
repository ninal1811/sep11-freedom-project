Today, I was exploring the tools (the Freedon Project Tool List) that I might be using for my Freedom Project. I wanted to make an appication where it combines a to-do list with a timer. Since I would be spending most of my time on coding a platform for my to-do list, it is best if I included a database for all the information and data. I have decided to use Firebase as my database because Firebase would store all the data and is able to update/refresh the page making it more efficient to use.
