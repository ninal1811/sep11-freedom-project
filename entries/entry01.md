There was two tools that I noticed that would help me accomplish my project, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) and

Throughout the Engineering Design Process, I have been defining my problem by exploring the tools and selecting the ones that would be helpful for my project. Alos, I researched how each tool works and determined were or not it would apply to the content I will be making. First of all, I have defined my problem which is finding Freedom project tools that I can apply to my Freedom Project.Furthermore, I researched more into the tools to determine if they actually appied to my project.

I wanted to make an appication where it combines a to-do list with a timer. Since I would be spending most of my time on coding a platform for my to-do list, it is best if I included a database for all the information and data. I have decided to use Firebase as my database because Firebase would store all the data and is able to update/refresh the page making it more efficient to use.
