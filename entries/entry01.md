Today, I was exploring the [Freedom Project Tool List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJFrErlAZvB-0V923QGOm4X3CwiceJsKot2R6Jz8Mdc/edit) and figuring which tool/tools I might be using for my Freedom Project. There was a tool that I noticed that would help me accomplish my project which is [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com).

Throughout the Engineering Design Process, I have been defining my problem by exploring the tools and selecting the ones that would be helpful for my project. Also, I researched how each tool works and determine whether or not it would apply to the content I will be making. First of all, I have defined my problem which is finding Freedom project tools that I can apply to my Freedom Project. Furthermore, I researched more into the tools to determine if they applied to my project. I wanted to make an application where it combines a to-do list with a timer. Since I would be spending most of my time coding a platform for my to-do list, it is best if I included a database for all the information and data. I have decided to use Firebase as my database because Firebase would store all the data and can update/refresh the page making it more efficient to use. When the to-do list is working without any issues, then I would be able to add other features such as a time to make it more beneficial to others to use. 

The skills I used would be organization and consideration. The skill organization allowed me to whiteboard my ideas about what tools I would have to learn for my project. It also helps me visually think about the tool I would need to use for certain parts. Consideration is the other skill I used because I am constantly thinking about making an application that would be beneficial to me but also others. It is key that I understand what I want to build while thinking about how people could be impacted. Initially, I think consideration and organization are skills that I have to begin with to make this project/application possible.
