Today, I've tried coding with Javascript and Firebase as I'm getting ready to create my To-Do List. I'm currently using Repl as the platform for coding my project and tinkering with my tool, Firebase. As I am still learning how to master Firebase, I watched videos on how [Javascript and Firebase](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=javascript+firebase) can be incorporated together in making a project such as a To-Do List.

I would say that I'm currently on step 5 of the Engineering Design Process, which **create a prototype**. Since the problem of my project is to help individuals who struggle in remembering their tasks. To solve this problem, I've research how Firebase can create a more stable platform in helping individuals save their data. [What Can Firebase Do?](https://firebasetutorials.com/what-can-firebase-do/) provided me with a lot of knowledge in understanding the different parts of Firebase and allowed me to clearly understand the part I would be using for my To-Do List. Out of the four categories (Develop, Quality, Analytics, and Grow), I believe that I would focus mainly on Develop since it contains key components of Authentication, Database, and Storage. I've already started tinkering with my tool which made me thinking about beginning to create my To-Do List. As I want to create a To-Do List that is beneficial and efficient for everyone, I'm thinking of making a system that works first then adding other add-on features later on.
